Installation is easy:

First, install composer:
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

Windows installation instructions are here: 
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows

Then pull down the libraries used on the project:

    php composer.phar install

OR

    composer install

This will download/install a lot of parts for silex & phpunit to work.

Now just run the tests to make sure that you've got stuff working!

    vendor/bin/phpunit tests


Want to check out the web stuff in the easiest way possible?  
1. From the command line, run the php builtin webserver to serve the site:

    php -S localhost:9999 -t www/

2. Browse to the hello world url of the site

    http://localhost:9999/hello/world

And you should get a page with just "hello world" in it.  Done, you've got the basics!
