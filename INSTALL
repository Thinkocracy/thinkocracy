Installation is easy:

First, install composer:
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
Windows installation instructions are here: 
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows

Then install the dependencies, to pull down the libraries used on the project:

php composer.phar install

OR

composer install

This will download/install a lot of stuff for silex & phpunit to work.

Now just run the tests to make sure that you've got stuff working!

vendor/bin/phpunit tests
